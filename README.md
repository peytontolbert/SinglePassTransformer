## Introduction

Welcome to the **Single-Pass Training Method** project! This project introduces an innovative approach to training transformer-based models by leveraging a single-pass dataset loading mechanism. By optimizing the training process, our method enhances efficiency, reduces computational overhead, and maintains high performance across various tasks.

## Features

- **Single-Pass Training:** Streamlined dataset loading for efficient training.
- **Transformer Integration:** Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer architectures.
- **Performance Optimization:** Reduced memory usage and faster convergence.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable components for customization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peytontolbert/single-pass-training.git
   cd single-pass-training
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model using the single-pass training method:
```
bash
python train.py --method single-pass --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 1e-3
```

### Comparison

For benchmarking against traditional training methods, use the `compare.py` script:
```
bash
python compare.py
```

This script runs both traditional and single-pass training methods, comparing metrics such as training time and memory usage.

## Single-Pass Training Method

### Overview

The single-pass training method revolutionizes the way datasets are loaded and processed during model training. Unlike traditional methods that may require multiple passes over the data, our approach ensures that each data batch is processed in a single pass, significantly enhancing training efficiency.

### Advantages

- **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of data loading operations, speeding up the training process.
- **Resource Optimization:** Lowers memory consumption by handling data more effectively.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates training on larger datasets without additional computational costs.
- **Simplified Pipeline:** Streamlines the training workflow, making it easier to integrate and manage.

### Implementation Details

Our single-pass training method is implemented in the `train.py` script. Key components include:

- **Dataset Loader:** Utilizes a single-pass data loading mechanism to feed data batches to the model.
- **Model Architecture:** Employs a simple transformer-based model (`SimpleTransformer`) designed for binary classification tasks.
- **Training Loop:** Optimizes the training loop to handle data in a single pass, updating model weights efficiently.
- **Evaluation:** Provides functions to evaluate model performance on new data.
